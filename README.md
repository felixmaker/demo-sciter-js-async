One demo to show:

 - How to write extension for Sciter.JS
 - How to use `new Promise()` in Sciter.JS and `std::thread::spawn` in Rust to make a function `async`

Note:

a) Before running the `test.html` in usciter, you need to build the dynamic library and then put it near the usciter.

b) This demo is built and tested on:
 - Rust v1.70.0 (MSVC)
 - Sciter v5.0.2.16
 - Windows 10 x64.
